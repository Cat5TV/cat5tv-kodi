## Thanks

This Kodi Add-On was [originally developed by nateuk](https://github.com/nateuk/plugin.video.category5) (circa 2015). Huge thanks to him for all the work that went into getting this off the ground. Since that time, the community has gradually taken on various updates. [solbu](https://github.com/solbu) has been instrumental in improving and fixing the add-on as needed, and various other community members have also pitched in. [Cat5TV](https://github.com/Cat5TV) (Robbie) code the back-end which provides the XML, plus do the occasional tweak here and there to the add-on itself.
