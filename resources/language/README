To add a new language, create the language folder (I.e. German/, French/ etc.)
Run "msginit -i English/strings.po". That will procduce an XX.po file, where XX is the Locale language of your system.
Move that file into your language folder, and name the file strings.po. For french it will be "mv fr.po French/strings.po"
